# infinity
Circular infinity Mirror project using addressable LED's, based on the Infinity Mirror designed by Kevin Osbock at WyoLum. Can also be ued as an awesome Coaster, if a 5V source can be embedded in it.

- The /fabricate folder has a FreeCAD file that is parametric - you can choose some of the major dimensions.
- The default settings is for a 200 mm long LED strip.
- The layer stack consists of (top to bottom):
-- Front bezel, which is optional, but gives a better visual result and protects the front mirror.
-- Front Mirror, which is one way or transluscent or whatever is the appropriate terminology (50% transmittance and 50% reflectance).
-- A stack of rings, whose total height is equal or greater than the width of the LED strip.
-- Back mirror, 100% transmittance.
-- Back support plate.
-- A stack of plates to enclose the microcontroller board. The cutout in the plates, and the number of plates needed depends on the size and height of the microcontroller PCB.
-- A final back cover plate.
